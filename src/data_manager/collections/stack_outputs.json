StackAI is an enterprise platform for building and deploying AI agents, focusing on governance and security. IT and Operations teams use StackAI to deploy internal applications that enhance and automate business processes, ranging from simple use cases like chatbots retrieving information from databases (e.g., Microsoft SharePoint) to sophisticated automations like performing in-depth research to generate investment memos. StackAI's powerful orchestration engine and extensive integrations simplify and accelerate business process automation. We provide the observability and controls needed to deploy AI Agents across your organization. Banks, defense companies, and governments trust us to accelerate their transition to an AI-first organization and streamline productivity.\n\nStackAI offers an end-to-end experience, allowing users to build both the AI agent's logic using a drag-and-drop workflow builder and its interface by selecting pre-built user interfaces.  Once configured, the AI Agent can be deployed and monitored easily. All components to build an AI application are available in StackAI, with varying levels of abstraction to help both non-technical and technical teams.  The entire data pipeline for deploying AI applications can be configured in a few steps. Users can build Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by dragging a “Knowledge Base” node into their workflow; default settings are optimized for 90% of use cases. This streamlines AI application development for all users. Function calling, implemented through “Tools,” is intuitive. Users select desired tools at the LLM level—no code or complex setup is required.\n\nStackAI integrates with established systems (SharePoint, SAP, Workday, Salesforce) and modern SaaS companies (Exa AI, Snowflake, Miro), making data ingestion seamless. StackAI provides the platform and forward-deployment engineers to help customers build and deploy complex use cases.  We offer guidance on AI strategy and tactical development, from testing new AI models to experimenting with different agentic architectures. StackAI supports enterprise customers with weekly co-building sessions led by forward-deployed engineers, GenAI-focused hackathons (Stackathons), and Quarterly Business Review (QBR) sessions.\n\nStackAI is SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, and GDPR compliant, with ISO 27001 certification in progress. For organizations with strict data residency requirements, StackAI offers On-Premise deployment options, critical for defense and finance.  This differentiates us from most providers who require cloud solutions. Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enables precise governance over who can modify and interact with LLMs, edit Knowledge Bases, or publish Workflows. Every component can be secured, authenticated (e.g., via SSO), and production-locked for accountability and control. Admins can enforce approval flows, protect production environments, and ensure only reviewed agents are launched, with version control. Admins receive real-time notifications of their agents' production status.\n"
