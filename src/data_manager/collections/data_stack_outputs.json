StackAI is an enterprise platform for building and deploying AI agents, focusing on governance and security. IT and Operations teams use StackAI to deploy internal applications that enhance and automate business processes, ranging from simple use cases like chatbots retrieving information from databases (e.g., Microsoft SharePoint) to sophisticated automations like in-depth research for investment memos. StackAI's orchestration engine and integrations simplify and accelerate business process automation. We provide the observability and controls needed to deploy AI Agents across your organization. Banks, defense companies, and governments trust us to accelerate their AI-first transition and streamline productivity.\n\nStackAI offers an end-to-end experience, allowing users to build AI agent logic using a drag-and-drop workflow builder and the interface by selecting pre-built user interfaces.  Once configured, the AI Agent can be deployed and monitored easily. All components to build an AI application are available in StackAI with varying levels of abstraction for both technical and non-technical teams. The data pipeline for deploying AI applications can be configured in a few steps. Users can build Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by dragging a “Knowledge Base” node into their workflow; default settings are optimized for most use cases. This streamlines AI application development for all users. Function calling, implemented through “Tools,” is intuitive. Users select the desired tools at the LLM level—no code or complex setup is required.\n\nStackAI integrates with established systems (SharePoint, SAP, Workday, Salesforce) and modern SaaS companies (Exa AI, Snowflake, Miro), making data ingestion seamless. StackAI provides the platform and forward-deployment engineers to help customers build and deploy complex use cases.  We offer guidance on AI strategy and tactical development, from testing new AI models to experimenting with agentic architectures. StackAI supports enterprise customers with weekly co-building sessions led by forward-deployed engineers, GenAI-focused hackathons (Stackathons), and Quarterly Business Review (QBR) sessions.\n\nStackAI is SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, and GDPR compliant, with ISO 27001 certification in progress. For organizations with strict data residency requirements, StackAI offers On-Premise deployment. This capability differentiates us from providers who force customers to use their cloud solution. Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enables admins to govern who can modify and interact with LLMs, edit Knowledge Bases, or publish Workflows. Every component can be secured, authenticated (e.g., via SSO), and production-locked for accountability and control. Admins can enforce approval flows, protect production environments, and ensure only reviewed agents are launched, with version control. Admins receive real-time notifications of agent status.\n"
